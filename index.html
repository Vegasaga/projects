            <h2>Visite Sichuan China</h2>
            <h3>
              Sichuan is famous for extremely spicy food and giant pandas.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Sichuan is a major province in southwest China. Sichuan’s name
              translates as “four rivers,” referring to the Jialing, Jinsha, Min
              and Tuo, which run through the geographically diverse province.
              The eastern part of the province, where Chengdu is located, is
              part of the Sichuan Basin. This is drastically different from the
              western part, which is part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is
              here that you will find the province’s highest mountains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The size of Sichuan Province is 485,000 km² (187,000 mi², much
              larger than Germany and a little larger than California). More
              than 80,500,000 (2010) live there. In such a large area, there are
              lots of attractions to see and things to do. Sichuan has a
              mountainous plateau in the west and mountains in the north and
              southeast. The northern mountains are the tallest and are
              beautiful. The mountains are on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau,
              and there are highlands above 12,000 feet (3,700 meters) with
              peaks rising above 5,000 meters.

                <h4>Yangzhou</h4>
                <p>
                  Yangzhou, a city in Jiangsu province, is located on the lower
                  reaches of the Yangti River and the Huaihe River. It was a
                  major ancient economic and cultural center in eastern China.
                  The city history dates back to 486 BC, when a long ditch
                  called the Han Ditch was dug. This project later led to the
                  construction of the Grand Canal that stretched over 1,000
                  miles to link the fertile south with Beijing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most interesting scenic spot in the city is perhaps Shou
                  Xihu, or Slim West Lake, which is so named because it
                  resembles the West Lake in Hangzhou in terms of natural
                  beauty, but is narrower and more twisted.

                <p>
                  Zhangjiajie is located in the northwestern part of Hunan
                  Province in China. Zhangjiajie is the top fever tourist
                  destination for fantastic nature admiration including the
                  Wulingyuan Scenic Area that is listed as the World Natural

                </p>
                <p>
                  Having been long popular among visitors and photographers,
                  Zhangjiajie is a treasure place with the perfect combination
                  of the idyllic beauty of Guilin, the strangeness of Yellow
                  Mountain, the peril of Mount Hua and the magnificence of Mount

                <p>
                  Shanghai's restaurants are among the finest in the country,
                  offering quality food and superior service. The city has a
                  plethora of food delights focusing on the traditions of
                  Beijing, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangzhou and of course the local
                  Benbang dishes. If visitors are homesick for Western food,
                  this is also available in the downtown area.
