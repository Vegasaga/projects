            <h3>Sichuanis famous for extremely spicy food and giant pandas.</h3>
            <p>
              Sichuan is a major province in southwest China. Sichuan’s name
              translates as “four rivers,” referring to the Jialing, Jinsha, Min
              and Tuo, which run through the geographically diverse province.
              The eastern part of the province, where Chengdu is located, is
              part of the Sichuan Basin. This is drastically different from the
              western part, which is part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is
              here that you will find the province’s highest mountains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The size of Sichuan Province is 485,000 km² (187,000 mi², much
              larger than Germany and a little larger than California). More
              than 80,500,000 (2010) live there. In such a large area, there are
              lots of attractions to see and things to do. Sichuan has a
              mountainous plateau in the west and mountains in the north and
              southeast. The northern mountains are the tallest and are
              beautiful. The mountains are on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau,
              and there are highlands above 12,000 feet (3,700 meters) with
              peaks rising above 5,000 meters.
